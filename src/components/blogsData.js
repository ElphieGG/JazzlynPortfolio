        details: "The day began with a trip to Manila, where I explored key historical sites like Rizal Park and Fort Santiago. At Rizal Park, I learned about the execution of Dr. Jos√© Rizal, a pivotal moment in Philippine history, and explored the park's memorials and museums. The visit to Fort Santiago, where Rizal was imprisoned before his execution, deepened my understanding of the country's struggles for independence, and the day ended with some leisure time at the Mall of Asia."

The experience deepened my understanding of maritime logistics, technology, and the need for continuous innovation and professional training in ensuring port safety and operational efficiency."
